a. defect

1. ink color hex/print diff. (data also diff.)
2. res. 4 color bar not in same place
3. object too small (phy.), NON-usr-friendly
4. paper (color ref.) reflect, more when ink increase

to fix a. ref. to peaper, use 'any' way to recog. color "bar"
\t edge dect. (?)
\t or peak vlaue method (?)

b. realtime prob.

1. no need realrime
2. cap. 1 frfam and send back to srv. , use py. to analysis
3. do avg. instead of one pixel

to fix b. use stream texh. (?)
\t use parl. instead of for loop (?)

come up with a idea -> ref. to this.readme.md
